# SIZES OF OBJECTS:
CAMERA_VIEW_HEIGHT = 10  # game units
# width is calculated using height to fit screen size
# camera view height and width define number of units that is shown on display.
# sizes of objects in px are calculated with this property
# therefore screen size doesn't affect how big objects seem on screen
# so users with different screen sizes have the same field of view
