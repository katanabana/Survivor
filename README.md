## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- **Combat**: Use the left mouse button to attack nearby monsters. Stay close enough to land a hit, but be careful—the monsters are always closing in!
- **Movement**: Navigate the game world with ease using the classic W, A, S, D keys for movement.
- **Survival**: Monsters will chase and attack if they get too close. Keep your distance to survive, but when you run out of health, it’s game over!
- **Persistence**: Your progress is saved automatically. Pick up right where you left off when you return to the game.
